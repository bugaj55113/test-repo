# ðŸ“š Test-Repo: Git Learning Project

This repository, **test-repo**, was created as an educational endeavor to understand the workings of Git and its branching strategies. The objective was to simulate a typical Git workflow, including feature branching, development, and releases.

## ðŸŒ± **Branch Structure**

Here's a brief overview of the repository's branches and their purpose:

- **master**: The primary branch containing the final, production-ready code.
- **develop**: The development branch where the latest work and merged features reside, waiting to be moved to the master for release.
- **feature_1, feature_2, feature_3**: These branches were created to simulate the process of working on separate features in a collaborative environment.
- **release**: Represents a state of the codebase that's ready to be released. A pre-production branch for final touches and testing.

## ðŸš« **Git Ignore**

Within the `release` branch, there's a `.gitignore` file that has been set up to exclude `.pp` files. This ensures that any file with this extension doesn't get committed to the repository.

## ðŸ’¡ **What I Learned**

Through this project, I familiarized myself with:
- Basic and advanced Git commands.
- The Git flow, a branching model for Git.
- How to efficiently manage and merge branches.
- The importance of a `.gitignore` file and its usage.
